#Query-Monitor-Ethereum-Contract-Events

This project is apart of my Ethereum Live project I developed for the Thinkful Bootcamp.

For beginners, you can listen and query smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain using web3.js. This is so you can specify actions to trigger when certain criteria are met in your code. 

In this tutorial I referenced on Ethereum Live, there will be a guide to demonstrate a method for querying and listening for smart contract events with web3. 

A important note to mention is that in order to query events for smart contracts on the Ethereum Blockchain you need to instantiate a contract first.
